A `flake8 <https://flake8.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ plugin to ban `PEP-420 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/>`__ implicit namespace packages.

Requirements
============

Python 3.7 to 3.10 supported.

Installation
============

First, install with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: sh

     python -m pip install flake8-no-pep420

Second, if you define Flake8’s ``select`` setting, add the ``INP`` prefix to it.
Otherwise, the plugin should be active by default.

Rationale
=========

Implicit namespace packages are directories of Python files without an ``__init__.py``.
They’re valid and importable, but unfortunately they’re silently ignored by *many* tools, like:

* `unittest test discovery <https://bugs.python.org/issue23882>`__ (and by extension, Django’s test runner)
* `Coverage.py <https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1024>`__
* Mypy without its `--namespace-packages option <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html#import-discovery>`__

Such silent failure leads to a false sense of security:

* Tests may look legitimate but never run
* Code may be untested but not affect coverage statistics
* Types may never be checked

PEP-420’s algorithm is non-trivial which is probably why such tools haven’t (yet) implemented it.

Rules
=====

INP001: File is part of an implicit namespace package.
------------------------------------------------------

flake8-no-pep420 will trigger this on the first line of any file that sits in a directory without a `__init__.py` file.

Often projects have a few root files *not* in packages, for which an ``__init__.py`` file should not be added.
For example, Django projects normally have a ``manage.py`` file in the root of their repository.
In these cases you can ignore the ``INP001`` error.
It’s possible to use ``# noqa: INP001`` to ignore the error in-line, but this isn’t possible if the first line is a `shebang <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>`__, such as in Django’s ``manage.py``.
As such, it’s preferable to use Flake8’s `per-file-ignores option <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/options.html#cmdoption-flake8-per-file-ignores>`__, for example in ``setup.cfg``:

.. code-block:: ini

    [flake8]
    # ...
    per-file-ignores =
        manage.py:INP001
